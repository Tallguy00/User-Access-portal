# Supabase Setup & Database Migration

This directory contains the database migration schema to connect your corporate Identity Directory and Access Requests manager with a real, live Supabase PostgreSQL backend.

## Structure

- `migrations/20260623000000_init_schema.sql`: Contains the complete, enterprise-ready database schema including:
  - **Departments**: Seeds default business units (Engineering, Finance, HR, Operations, Marketing).
  - **System Applications**: Seeds central system assets (AWS, PostgreSQL, Sharepoint, VPN, Slack, SAP).
  - **Profiles**: Central employee roster linked dynamically to `auth.users` via foreign keys and PostgreSQL database triggers.
  - **Access Requests**: Standardizing multi-role security models with priority fields, justification, start/end dates, attachments (JSONB), and credential structures.
  - **Notifications & Audit Logs**: High-performance logging tables for corporate compliance tracking.
  - **Row Level Security (RLS) & Security Policies**:
    - Complete protection against arbitrary modifications.
    - Owners can only manage their own requests.
    - Managers can only view/approve requests from their own departments.
    - IT Admins & Super Admins get central management keys to approve, complete, or reject requests globally.
